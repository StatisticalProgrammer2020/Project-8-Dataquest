# DQ R-Project 8: Analyzing Movie Ratings
This is my eighth project in Dataquest towards my journey in R Programming. This project aims to apply the practice of web-scraping using R to extract relevant data. Specifically, the goal is to extract the top 30 movies in the IMDB website from March to July 2020. In this project, the following concepts are used to achieve the given problem:
- Webscraping functions
- Vectorization
- String Manipulation
- Plotting/Visualization
